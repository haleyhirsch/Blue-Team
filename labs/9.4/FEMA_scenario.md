# Hacktivist Threat Alert Activity

## Preventative Measures
* if there is a known list of companies being targeted - contact those companies directly
* advise those companies to make sure all security related software is up-to-date and firewalls are configured properly
  * continously monitor all logs to watch for anamoly behavior trends as a Zero Day Vulnerability will not have a known signature
* prepare, and update if needed, your recovery plan and business continuity plan 
* be sure any company that does find anamoly behavior to occur on their systems or an attack occurs notifies us so we can all be aware of what is happening


## Planning & Policy
* audit the users - the closed account could've created a new one under a false persona 
* review logs from before and after the account closure
* create a procedure of policy for remote logon
* containment and eradication of whatever the malware is 
* check to see if we have DDOS/DOS protection and if not then make sure we set up a policy for it
* onboarding/offboarding policy
* privilege creeping 
* policy to confirm employee emails haven't been pwned

# A Company Under Attack

## Detection & Response 
* use Netflow to evaluate traffic 
* make sure logs are feeding into our SIEMs
* IDS
* asset inventory and user accounts audit
* create CSIRT - assign who has what role and responsibilites
* block domain, user training, re-evaluate email filters for better spam recognition 

## Notifications & Stakeholder Communications
* not being transparent
* didn't act like he cared about the threats
