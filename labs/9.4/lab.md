# Communications Plans

## SQL Injection 
### Developing an Incident Communications Plan (Activity 5.3)
 ``` You are the CSIRT leader for a major ecommerce website, and you are currently responding to a security incident where you believe attackers used a SQL injection attack to steal transaction records from your backend database. Currently, only the core CSIRT members are responding. ```

* Develop a communication plan that describes the nature, timing, and audiences for communications to the internal and external stakeholders that you believe need to be notified.

<u>Internal</u>
* Incident commander needs to designate a Communications lead and Ops lead
* Determine the scope of the attack - were the attackers successful or not
* Describe the incident that occurred - technical aspects of the incident, what systems it affected
* What platforms you can use to discuss the incident (slack, email, etc.)
* Create collaborative document (Google docs) where everyone can leave notes on what works/doesn't work
* Time of occurence 
* Estimate for how long it will take to recover

<u>External</u>
* Have communications lead contact PR team to create email to push out to entire customer base - general and vague
